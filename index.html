      <h1>My New Friend</h1>
      <p>
        Good Morning Brother, how are you doing? Its been a great time coding
        with you brother. Writing while listening a great song, it gives me
        drive to write. I learned a very new concept from bhagwat geeta, and
        that is you should never think like that if I get that then I will
        become happy. I should also not think that, the place where I am staying
        is a good place and be satisfied with that. I should be growing and its
        process of growing that I should be fond of and like.

      <h1>Facts on life</h1>
      <p>
        Justice is not a concept of life. Its just a human concept. But still
        its just a belief that "Everything in this universe happens only and
        only for good". Real life is just stay away from evil and be good and
        live with good and be happy. Growth is the only destination.
      </p>

        Never think that, you'll get happiness by achieving something. Also,
        never think that you'll get happiness by staying here. You'll get
        happiness in the growing and moving forward.
